# üó£Ô∏è Threat Detection in Network Traffic

## üöÄ  Project Overview
This project is an advanced cybersecurity solution that uses machine learning to protect networks from attacks. The system employs two different models:

- A **binary classifier** that acts as the first line of defense by accurately separating normal network activity from malicious threats.
- A **multi-class classifier** that identifies the specific type of attack (e.g., DoS, PortScan, etc.).

The models are highly effective, demonstrating exceptional performance in distinguishing between benign and malicious traffic. They are designed to minimize false alarms while maintaining a very high rate of successful detection, providing security teams with a reliable and powerful tool to defend against modern cyber threats.

- [Data Prep Script](https://github.com/akhileshpok/Threat_Detection_In_Network_Traffic/blob/main/notebooks/Capstone_project_data_prep.ipynb) - This Python script automates the full data preparation and cleaning pipeline for the CICIDS2017 dataset. The code first loads all of the daily CSV files, combines them into a single large DataFrame, and performs initial cleaning steps like standardizing column names and handling infinite or missing values. Finally, it creates two separate, ready-to-use datasets: one for a multiclass classification task that preserves the original attack types, and a second for a binary classification task where all attacks are simplified to a single "malicious" label.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### CICIDS2017 Binary Classification, Multi-Class Classicification Pipelines:

This project implements two complete machine learning pipelines to detect network intrusions using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The pipelines are composed of the following stages:

#### 1. Data Loading
- Loads a pre-processed subset of the CICIDS2017 dataset and performs stratified sampling to create a smaller subset for efficient processing.
- Ensures that the label column is binary: `"BENIGN"` or `"ATTACK"` for the binary classifier.
- Ensures that the label column has 5 distinct classes for the multi-class classifier. 
- Uses `LabelEncoder` to convert categorical labels into a numerical format.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Initial Data Inspection**  
  Displays the first few rows of the dataset, data types, non-null counts, and descriptive statistics for numerical features.
- **Data Quality Checks**  
  Identifies and reports any missing values and unique values per feature.
- **Target Variable Analysis**  
  Visualizes the class distribution of the target variable (`label_final_display`) to check for class imbalance.
- **Feature Distributions**  
  Plots histograms and box plots for key numerical features to understand their distributions and identify potential outliers.
- **Relationship Analysis**  
  Generates a correlation heatmap to show the relationships between all numerical features and creates a pair plot to visualize relationships between a selected subset of features, colored by the target class.


#### 3. Train/Test Split
- Splits the dataset into:
  - **Training set**
  - **Test set**
- Stratified sampling is applied to maintain label balance across splits.

#### 4. Feature Engineering
- **Standard Scaling:** Normalizes features using `StandardScaler`.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces feature dimensionality with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** SMOTE has been used to synthetically balance the training dataset.


#### 5. Classification Task ML Modeling
Trains and evaluates the following models for both **Binary** and **Multi-Class** classification tasks using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The model selection was designed to cover a spectrum from simple to complex, ensuring robust baselines and high-performing classifiers suitable for network intrusion detection.

#### ‚úÖ Models Selected and Justification

  *Why Chosen:* Establishes a performance floor, allowing meaningful evaluation of more sophisticated models.
- **Logistic Regression**  
  *Purpose:* A linear classifier optimized using gradient descent.  
  *Why Chosen:* Simple, interpretable, and often surprisingly competitive on high-dimensional tabular data. Also used as the meta-learner in stacking due to its generalization ability.
- **Random Forest**

  *Purpose:* A gradient boosting framework known for speed and performance.  
  *Why Chosen:* Handles class imbalance, supports regularization, and captures complex interactions. Performs particularly well on structured datasets like CICIDS2017.
- **Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)**  
  *Purpose:* A deep learning model with dense, fully connected layers.  
  *Why Chosen:* Can model complex, non-linear feature interactions. Suitable when the dataset is large and diverse enough to benefit from deep architectures.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  
  *Purpose:* A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model sequential or temporal dependencies.  
  *Why Chosen:* Especially useful when modeling time-based or sequential network traffic flows, as LSTM captures dependencies across time steps.
- **Stacking Classifier (Ensemble)**  
  *Purpose:* An ensemble method that combines predictions of multiple base models via a meta-learner.  
  *Why Chosen:* Leverages the strengths of diverse models (e.g., LogReg, RF, XGBoost) to improve predictive performance and robustness. Often outperforms individual classifiers in complex tasks like intrusion detection.

## üéõÔ∏è Hyperparameter Optimisation
### Binary Classifier

For the selected binary classifier, which is a **Stacking Ensemble**, the hyperparameter optimisation focused on tuning the individual base learners‚Äîincluding classical machine learning models and deep learning architectures‚Äîas well as the meta-learner to achieve the best predictive performance.

#### Base Learners and Hyperparameters Tuned

**Logistic Regression:**  
The Logistic Regression base model was tuned using `GridSearchCV` with a pipeline.

- Regularization strength inverse, tested across `[0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]` to control overfitting (`C`)  
- Optimization algorithms tested were `'lbfgs'` (supports only `'l2'` penalty) and `'saga'` (supports `'l1'` and `'elasticnet'` penalties, but here only `'l2'` was used) (`solver`)  
- Only `'l2'` penalty was considered to ensure compatibility with solvers (`penalty`)  

**Random Forest (RF):**  
The Random Forest base model was tuned using `GridSearchCV` with a pipeline.

- Number of trees, tested at 100, 200, and 300 (`n_estimators`)  
- Maximum depth of trees, tested at 10, 20, and unlimited (`max_depth`)  
- Minimum samples required to split a node, tested at 2 and 5 (`min_samples_split`)  
- Minimum samples required at a leaf node, tested at 1 and 2 (`min_samples_leaf`)  
- Number of features considered for the best split, tested with `'sqrt'` and `'log2'` (`max_features`)  

**XGBoost:**  
The XGBoost base model was tuned using `GridSearchCV` with a pipeline.

- Number of boosting rounds, tested at 100 and 200 (`n_estimators`)  
- Maximum depth of trees, tested at 3 and 5 (`max_depth`)  
- Step size shrinkage used to prevent overfitting, tested at 0.01 and 0.1 (`learning_rate`)  
- Subsample ratio of the training instances, tested at 0.7 and 1.0 (`subsample`)  

**Feedforward Neural Network (FFN):**  
The FFN model was optimized using Optuna hyperparameter tuning with early stopping and pruning.

- Learning rate (`lr`) was searched on a log-uniform scale between `1e-5` and `1e-2`.  
- Dropout rate (`dropout_rate`) was tested between `0.1` and `0.5`.  
- Weight decay (`weight_decay`) was tuned on a log-uniform scale between `1e-5` and `1e-2`.  
- The model was trained using mini-batches with a fixed batch size.  
- Binary cross-entropy loss with logits was used during training.  
- Early stopping with patience of 7 epochs was implemented to prevent overfitting.  
- Optuna‚Äôs Median Pruner was used to stop unpromising trials early.  
- The primary evaluation metric was the validation F1-score.

**Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM):**  
The LSTM model was similarly optimized via Optuna with early stopping and pruning.

- Learning rate (`lr`), dropout rate (`dropout_rate`), and weight decay (`weight_decay`) were tuned in similar ranges as the FFN.  
- The number of hidden units and layers were fixed based on prior experiments.  
- Training used mini-batches and binary cross-entropy loss with logits.  
- Early stopping with a patience of 5 epochs was applied.  
- Optuna‚Äôs Median Pruner was used to prune non-promising trials.  
- Validation F1-score was used as the target metric for optimization.

#### Meta-Learner  
The meta-learner in the stacking ensemble is a **Logistic Regression** model configured with default parameters optimized for binary classification. Unlike the base learners, explicit hyperparameter tuning was minimal or not performed for the meta-learner due to:

- The meta-learner‚Äôs relatively simple architecture requiring fewer hyperparameters.  
- Use of the `'lbfgs'` solver with L2 regularization by default, which generally provides robust performance.  
- The focus on tuning base learners where most performance gains are realized.

Cross-validation during stacking training (3-fold stratified K-Fold) implicitly ensures the meta-learner generalizes well without overfitting. Future improvements may explore tuning regularization strength (`C`) or solver types if needed.

#### Optimisation Strategy

- **Grid Search / Random Search:** Hyperparameter combinations for classical models were explored using Grid Search or Randomized Search with cross-validation on the training set.  
- **Optuna Bayesian Optimization:** The FFN and LSTM deep learning models were tuned using Optuna‚Äôs Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampler for efficient hyperparameter exploration, combined with pruning to reduce computation time.  
- **Evaluation Metric:** The F1-score for the positive (attack) class was used as the primary metric to balance precision and recall.  
- **Early Stopping:** Models supporting it (e.g., XGBoost, FFN, LSTM) used early stopping to prevent overfitting.  
- **Resource Considerations:** To manage computational cost, the search space was carefully selected based on domain knowledge and prior experiments, with pruning mechanisms further reducing wasted resources.

### Multi-Class Classifier

For the selected multi-class classifier, which is a **Stacking Ensemble**, hyperparameter optimization targeted tuning of individual base learners as well as the meta-learner to maximize overall multi-class predictive performance.

- Penalty set to `'l2'` to ensure robust multi-class performance (`penalty`)  
- Multi-class strategy set to `'multinomial'` (default with `'lbfgs'`)  

**Random Forest (RF):**  
The Random Forest base model was tuned using `GridSearchCV` with a pipeline.

- Number of trees, tested at 100, 200, and 300 (`n_estimators`)  
- Maximum depth of trees, tested at 10, 20, and unlimited (`max_depth`)  
- Minimum samples required to split a node, tested at 2 and 5 (`min_samples_split`)  
- Minimum samples required at a leaf node, tested at 1 and 2 (`min_samples_leaf`)  
- Number of features considered for the best split, tested with `'sqrt'` and `'log2'` (`max_features`)  

**XGBoost:**

- Subsample ratio of training instances (`subsample`) was searched between 0.5 and 1.0.  
- Subsample ratio of columns when constructing trees (`colsample_bytree`) was searched between 0.5 and 1.0.  
- Minimum loss reduction (`gamma`) was searched between 0.0 and 1.0 to control complexity.  
- L1 (`reg_alpha`) and L2 (`reg_lambda`) regularization parameters were searched on log scales from 1e-8 to 10.0 for weight penalties.  
- Multi-class objective was set to `'multi:softprob'` with the appropriate number of classes.  
- Early pruning of trials was enabled via Optuna's Median Pruner to improve efficiency.  
- Model performance was evaluated using stratified 3-fold cross-validation with the F1-macro score as the optimization metric.

#### Deep Learning Models

- Hidden units per LSTM layer tested from 50 to 200  
- Dropout and recurrent dropout rates tested at 0.2 and 0.5  
- Sequence length input adjusted based on feature representation  
- Optimizers tested included Adam and RMSprop with learning rates between 0.0001 and 0.01  
- Early stopping used to prevent overfitting  

#### Meta-Learner

The meta-learner in the stacking ensemble is a **Logistic Regression** model configured for multi-class classification with default parameters. Specific considerations include:

- Multi-class strategy set to `'multinomial'` to handle multiple classes jointly.  
- Solver configured to `'lbfgs'` for efficient multi-class optimization.  
- Minimal explicit hyperparameter tuning was performed given the meta-learner‚Äôs relatively simple architecture and reliance on base learner outputs.

Cross-validation during stacking training (3-fold stratified K-Fold) ensured generalization of the meta-learner without overfitting. Future improvements could include tuning regularization strength (`C`) or exploring alternative meta-learners better suited for multi-class problems.

#### Optimisation Strategy

- **Grid Search / Random Search:** Hyperparameter combinations were explored via Grid Search or Randomized Search with cross-validation on the training data.  
- **Evaluation Metric:** The macro-averaged F1-score was used as the primary metric to balance precision and recall across all classes equally.  
- **Early Stopping:** Applied where supported (e.g., XGBoost, deep learning models) to prevent overfitting during training.  
- **Resource Considerations:** The search space was narrowed based on domain knowledge and prior experience to balance thoroughness and computational efficiency.

</div>

The top-performing models (**Stacking, Random Forest, XGBoost**) perform exceptionally well across all key metrics:

- **F1-score (Positive Class):** ~0.986 ‚Äî very high, indicating excellent precision and recall balance.

- **ROC AUC:** ~0.999 ‚Äî near-perfect ability to separate classes.

- **Average Precision:** ~0.997 ‚Äî strong performance even under class imbalance.

The **Deep Learning (DL)** models show decent results but lag behind tree-based methods, possibly due to:

- Need for more data or refined hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
- Impact of noisy or redundant features.
- Potential overfitting from insufficient regularization.

**Logistic Regression** performs poorly, likely because:

- Linear assumptions limit ability to model non-linear patterns.
- Class imbalance affects performance.
- It‚Äôs less capable of capturing complex traffic behaviors.

Overall, the **Stacking Ensemble** offers the best combination of metrics and is the preferred model for deployment in the **binary classification** task.

The top-performing models ‚Äî **Stacking Classifier**, **Random Forest (Untuned and Tuned)** ‚Äî demonstrate strong and consistent performance across all key evaluation metrics:

- **Weighted F1-score**: In the range of **0.9864‚Äì0.9875**, indicating a well-balanced precision and recall across all classes, including minority ones.
- **Micro-average ROC AUC**: Approximately **0.9981‚Äì0.9994**, showing near-perfect discrimination capability across all classes.
- **Micro-average Precision-Recall Average Precision (AP)**: Between **0.9943‚Äì0.9983**, reflecting excellent predictive performance even in the presence of class imbalance.

#### Per-Class Performance Highlights:

The top models not only perform well overall, but also excel across individual attack classes:

- **BENIGN** and **DoS Hulk** consistently show near-perfect ROC AUC and Average Precision across tree-based and tuned deep learning models.
- **PortScan** and **DDoS** are also predicted with high confidence (ROC AUC ~0.998+, AP ~0.995) by most top models.
- **rare_attack** class ‚Äî the most challenging due to its sparsity ‚Äî still achieves high ROC AUC (~0.99+) and AP (~0.89‚Äì0.92) with **Stacking**, **RF (Tuned)**, and **XGBoost (Tuned)**, showing strong minority class sensitivity.

#### Model Family Observations:

**Tree-based models (Random Forest and XGBoost)** consistently outperform deep learning and linear models, likely due to:

- Robustness to noisy or redundant features in network traffic.
- Efficient handling of class imbalance and skewed distributions.
- Better generalization on structured tabular data, even without extensive tuning.

**Deep Learning models** show reasonable but comparatively lower performance. Despite effective hyperparameter tuning, further gains may require:

- Larger or augmented datasets for better generalization.
- More expressive architectures (e.g., CNNs or attention-based models).
- Feature engineering or dimensionality reduction to reduce noise.

**Logistic Regression** lags behind, with weaker performance on minority classes like **DDoS** and **rare_attack**, due to:

- Inability to model complex, non-linear relationships.
- Sensitivity to class imbalance, especially without advanced weighting strategies.

#### Final Recommendation:

The **Stacking Ensemble** model offers the best combination of **robustness**, **per-class accuracy**, and **overall predictive strength**, making it the most suitable candidate for deployment in **multi-class intrusion detection systems** using the CICIDS2017 dataset.

## üî¨ Future Work & Enhancements
### Model Optimization  
Due to compute and time constraints, the current pipelines have been developed and evaluated on a small stratified subset of the full CICIDS2017 dataset. Future work should focus on scaling the training and tuning processes to the entire dataset to potentially improve model robustness and generalization. Additionally, deeper hyperparameter tuning, especially for deep learning models, is necessary to unlock their full potential. Exploring more sophisticated deep learning architectures such as CNNs or advanced ensemble methods could further enhance performance for both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
### Data & Feature Refinement  
Given the subset limitation, expanding the dataset size could allow for development of new, domain-specific features and application of more advanced feature selection techniques. Investigating cost-sensitive learning approaches or more refined resampling strategies will help better address class imbalance challenges inherent in the full dataset. This could lead to improved model efficiency and interpretability.
### Productionization  
Building a complete end-to-end deployment pipeline remains a priority, including real-time inference, comprehensive model monitoring, and automated retraining workflows. These steps will be crucial to transition from the current proof-of-concept stage‚Äîlimited by dataset size and tuning scope‚Äîto a scalable, practical operational solution suitable for real-world cybersecurity environments.
