## Model Description

**Input:**  
The model takes as input a feature vector of length 78, representing preprocessed network traffic data, including derived statistical and protocol-specific features. The features are normalized and optionally transformed using PCA before classification.

**Output:**  
The output is a binary classification label indicating whether the input network traffic is **BENIGN** or **ATTACK**. Additionally, the model outputs the probability score for the positive class (ATTACK) to enable threshold tuning or further analysis.

**Model Architecture:**  
The model is an ensemble Stacking Classifier combining multiple base learners (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) whose predictions are combined using a meta-classifier for improved predictive performance and robustness.

## Intended Use

- **Primary use case**: Network intrusion detection — binary classification of network traffic as BENIGN or ATTACK.
- **Users**: Security analysts, cybersecurity systems, researchers.
- **Not intended for**: Real-time deployment without optimization; environments with drastically different network traffic than CICIDS2017.

## Training Data

- **Dataset**: CICIDS2017
- **Original dataset size**: 2,827,876 rows × 79 columns
- **Subset used**: 282,788 rows × 79 columns (~10% of the original dataset)
- **Binary label distribution in the subset**:
  - BENIGN: 227,132 samples
  - ATTACK: 55,656 samples
- **Class names**: BENIGN, ATTACK
- **Test set size**: 56,558 samples, 78 features
- **Preprocessing**: PCA for dimensionality reduction, SMOTE for class imbalance, and standard normalization
- **Class balance (test set)**: Approx. 80% BENIGN, 20% ATTACK
- **Data source**: [CICIDS2017 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

> ⚠️ **Note**: Due to significant computational and time constraints, the entire model pipeline — including preprocessing, training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation — was conducted on a **subset** of the original dataset. The subset was carefully sampled to preserve the original class distribution while reducing processing time. Therefore, the reported performance metrics reflect this sampled subset and may vary when applied to the full dataset or real-world traffic.

### Data Sampling and Split Methodology

Due to computational and time constraints, a stratified subset of approximately 283,000 samples was created from the full CICIDS2017 dataset. This was achieved by:

- Calculating the proportion of each class in the original dataset.
- Sampling a fixed number of rows per class proportional to these original class distributions.
- This stratified sampling ensured that the subset maintained class distribution representative of the full dataset within the limited sample size.

The test set of 56,558 samples was then randomly held out from this stratified subset, ensuring consistent class proportions in both training and test sets.

## Performance

- **Metrics**:
  - F1 (Positive class - ATTACK): 0.9864
  - Precision (ATTACK): 0.98
  - Recall (ATTACK): 0.99
  - Accuracy: 0.99
  
- **Classification Report:**

  | Class  | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
  |--------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
  | BENIGN | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 45,427  |
  | ATTACK | 0.98      | 0.99   | 0.99     | 11,131  |

- **Confusion Matrix:**

  |                | Predicted BENIGN | Predicted ATTACK |
  |----------------|------------------|------------------|
  | Actual BENIGN  | 45,230           | 197              |
  | Actual ATTACK  | 108              | 11,023           |

- **Validation Method**: Hold-out test set from CICIDS2017.
- **Test Dataset**: Same as above, representative of real-world traffic in CICIDS2017.

## Limitations

- The model was trained and evaluated exclusively on CICIDS2017 data and may not generalize well to other network environments or attack types.
- May produce false positives or negatives on rare or novel attack patterns.
- Not optimized for real-time inference — additional engineering required.
- Assumes input features are preprocessed identically as in training (PCA, SMOTE).

---

## Trade-offs

- **Accuracy vs. Interpretability**: High performance achieved via stacking ensemble reduces model interpretability.
- **Precision vs. Recall**: Slight preference toward high recall on ATTACK class to minimize missed detections at some cost of false positives.
- **Resource Usage**: Ensemble stacking requires more compute and memory than simpler models, which may limit deployment on resource-constrained devices.

---

## Ethical Considerations

- Potential bias if training data does not represent all attack types or network scenarios.
- Steps taken to mitigate imbalance with SMOTE, but ongoing monitoring and retraining recommended.
- Model decisions should be complemented with human analyst review where possible.

---

## Caveats and Recommendations

- ✅ Deploy only in environments similar to CICIDS2017 network traffic distribution.  
- ✅ Retrain regularly to account for new attack vectors or network changes.  
- ✅ Use with additional anomaly detection layers or alerting mechanisms for robust defense.  
- ❌ Avoid deployment in networks with substantially different traffic patterns without thorough validation.  
- ❌ Do not rely solely on this model for critical security decisions without human oversight.
