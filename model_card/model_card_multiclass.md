## Model Description

**Input:**  
A vector of 78 numerical features derived from preprocessed network traffic, standardized and transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**Output:**  
Multi-class label for one of the following:
- `BENIGN`
- `DDoS`
- `DoS Hulk`
- `PortScan`
- `rare_attack` (aggregated rare attacks)

Also returns class probabilities for each prediction.

**Model Architecture:**  
An ensemble **Stacking Classifier** combining predictions from:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (tuned)
- XGBoost (tuned)

The meta-learner is a Logistic Regression classifier.

## Intended Use

- **Use Case**: Detect and classify network traffic behavior (normal vs. different attack types)
- **Target Users**: Cybersecurity analysts, IT admins, IDS developers  
- **Not Suitable For**: Real-time applications or environments not resembling CICIDS2017

---
## Training Data

- **Dataset**: Subset of the CICIDS2017 intrusion detection dataset  
- **Original dataset size**: 2,827,876 rows × 79 columns  
- **Subset size used for modeling**: 49,992 rows × 78 features  
- **Test set size**: 9,999 samples  
- **Class labels**: BENIGN, DDoS, DoS Hulk, PortScan, rare_attack  
- **Preprocessing**: PCA for dimensionality reduction, SMOTE for class imbalance, and standard normalization
- **Data source**: [CICIDS2017 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

> ⚠️ **Note**: Due to significant computational and time constraints, the entire model pipeline — including preprocessing, training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation — was conducted on a **subset** of the original dataset. The subset was carefully sampled to preserve the original class distribution while reducing processing time. Therefore, the reported performance metrics reflect this sampled subset and may vary when applied to the full dataset or real-world traffic.

### Data Sampling and Split Methodology

Due to computational and time constraints, a stratified subset of approximately 50,000 samples was created from the full CICIDS2017 dataset. This was achieved by:

- Calculating the proportion of each class in the original dataset.
- Sampling a fixed number of rows per class proportional to these original class distributions.
- This stratified sampling ensured that the subset maintained class distribution representative of the full dataset within the limited sample size.

The test set of 9,999 samples was then randomly held out from this stratified subset, ensuring consistent class proportions in both training and test sets.

### Preprocessing

- Standardization of features to zero mean and unit variance.
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) applied to address class imbalance in the training data.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The model was trained and evaluated on this reduced, stratified subset of CICIDS2017 and **not** on the full dataset. Performance metrics should be interpreted within this context and may not generalize fully to the original dataset.

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

- Only a small, stratified subset of the CICIDS2017 dataset (49,992 samples) was used for the entire modeling pipeline — including preprocessing, training, and tuning — due to limited computational resources and time.
- Consequently, the reported performance metrics may not generalize to the full dataset or real-world deployment scenarios.
- The current model serves as a **proof-of-concept** and is **not optimized for production**. Further scaling, retraining on the full dataset, and extensive validation are required before operational use.

## Limitations

- Trained exclusively on the CICIDS2017 dataset; may not generalize well to other network environments.
- Model trained on a small subset (~0.7%) of the original CICIDS2017 dataset, which may impact generalizability to the full spectrum of attack types and network traffic behaviors.
- Performance on rare_attack class is limited by data sparsity.
- Additional work needed for real-time inference.
- Relies on specific preprocessing pipeline (PCA, SMOTE).

---

## Trade-offs

- **Accuracy vs Interpretability**: Ensemble models reduce transparency.
- **Recall vs Precision**: Prioritizes recall on attack types to reduce false negatives.
- **Compute Cost**: Higher due to model complexity and ensemble strategy.

---

## Ethical Considerations

- May underperform on unseen attack types or network configurations.
- False positives may lead to unnecessary alerts.
- Human review recommended before acting on predictions.

---

## Recommendations

- ✅ Retrain periodically with up-to-date network traffic and threats.  
- ✅ Use with anomaly detection or rule-based systems for robust protection.  
- ✅ Validate model against production traffic before deployment.  
- ❌ Avoid using it as a black-box decision tool without oversight.
