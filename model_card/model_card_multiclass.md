## Model Description

**Input:**  
A vector of 78 numerical features derived from preprocessed network traffic, normalized and optionally transformed using PCA.

**Output:**  
Multi-class label for one of the following:
- `BENIGN`
- `DDoS`
- `DoS Hulk`
- `PortScan`
- `rare_attack` (aggregated rare attacks)

Also returns class probabilities for each prediction.

**Model Architecture:**  
An ensemble **Stacking Classifier** combining predictions from:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (tuned)
- XGBoost (tuned)

The meta-learner is a Logistic Regression classifier.

## Intended Use

- **Use Case**: Detect and classify network traffic behavior (normal vs. different attack types)
- **Target Users**: Cybersecurity analysts, IT admins, IDS developers  
- **Not Suitable For**: Real-time applications or environments not resembling CICIDS2017

---

## Training Data

- **Dataset**: Subset of CICIDS2017 (official size: 2,827,876 rows, 79 features)
- **Subset Used**: 19,992 samples (due to time and compute constraints)
- **Test Size**: 3,999 samples (randomly held out from the subset)
- **Features**: 78 numerical values  
- **Classes**: BENIGN, DDoS, DoS Hulk, PortScan, rare_attack 
- **Preprocessing**: Standardization, PCA, SMOTE
- **Note**: The full dataset was not used for model training or tuning.

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

- Due to limited computational resources and time, only a subset of the CICIDS2017 dataset (19,992 rows) was used for model development and evaluation.
- As a result, performance metrics reflect outcomes on a constrained dataset and may not be representative of performance on the full dataset or in real-world deployments.
- This model should be viewed as a proof-of-concept, not as a production-ready intrusion detection system.

## Limitations

- Trained on CICIDS2017 only — may not generalize to other network types.
- Model trained on a small subset (~0.7%) of the original CICIDS2017 dataset, which may impact generalizability to the full spectrum of attack types and network traffic behaviors.
- Performance on rare_attack class is limited by data sparsity.
- Additional work needed for real-time inference.
- Relies on specific preprocessing (PCA, SMOTE).

---

## Trade-offs

- **Accuracy vs Interpretability**: Ensemble models reduce transparency.
- **Recall vs Precision**: Prioritizes recall on attack types to reduce false negatives.
- **Compute Cost**: Higher due to model complexity and ensemble strategy.

---

## Ethical Considerations

- May underperform on unseen attack types or network configurations.
- False positives may lead to unnecessary alerts.
- Human review recommended before acting on predictions.

---

## Recommendations

- ✅ Retrain periodically with up-to-date network traffic and threats.  
- ✅ Use with anomaly detection or rule-based systems for robust protection.  
- ✅ Validate model against production traffic before deployment.  
- ❌ Avoid using it as a black-box decision tool without oversight.
